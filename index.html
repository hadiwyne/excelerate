      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p id="introduction-para">As part of our internship project with GlobalShala, I, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khabdulhadis/">Abdul Hadi</a>, served as a team-lead with two other team members: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrick-nyarko-a01814104/">Derrick Nyarko</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahmida-salma-648282253/">Fahmida Salma</a>. We were tasked with analyzing the performance of 11 Facebook ad campaigns targeting two primary audiences: <b>“students”</b> and <b>“educators and principals.”</b>. In the first week of the project, we focused on identifying underperforming campaigns based on key performance indicators such as: Cost Per Click (CPC), Click-Through Rate (CTR), Unique Link Clicks (ULC), and Efficiency Score (ULC/Amount Spent).<br><br> Our objective was to recommend one campaign for removal to improve overall budget efficiency. Using R, we performed the necessary calculations and created visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pie charts, to support our insights. This phase laid the groundwork for optimizing marketing spend by reallocating budget toward higher-performing campaigns. <br><br> This was a four weeks internship program, with individual tasks divided into weeks. Here's a breakdown of how our tasks were divided. Clicking on the Week will lead you to the task of that week.</p>

Our dataset was in an xlsx Excel file, which you can download by clicking <a href="/assets/EXCELERATE_main.xlsx" target="_blank">here</a>. There were two empty columns: <b>@dropdown...17</b> and <b>@dropdown...18</b> We dropped these columns for ease in readability. Some column names were also renamed for the same purpose.<br> Following the initial cleaning, key performance metrics such as Cost Per Click (CPC), Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Unique Link Clicks (ULC) were calculated or validated to support further analysis. These metrics formed the foundation for subsequent visualizations and campaign evaluations.</p>

        <h2 id="analyzing-metric">Analyzing Metrics to Suggest Dropping a Campaign</h2>
        <p id="interpreting-plt">To make a data-driven recommendation for which campaign to drop, we focused on key performance metrics: <b>Cost Per Click (CPC)</b> and <b>the relationship between Amount Spent and Unique Link Clicks (ULC)</b>. These together highlight cost-efficiency and engagement effectiveness.</p>
        <div class="cpc-bar-chart">
          <img src="/assets/img/fig_14.png" alt="CPC by Campaign Bar Chart" class="bar-chart">
          <p id="interpreting-plt"><b>CPC (Cost Per Click)</b> measures how much each click on an ad costs, calculated by dividing the total spend by the number of clicks received: <br><br><b>CPC = Amount Spent / Total Clicks</b><br> <b>Lower CPC</b> indicates more cost-effective campaigns. Simply put: more clicks for less money. <br> <b>Higher CPC</b> suggests inefficient spending and possible underperformance. <br><br> By evaluating CPC across campaigns, we can quickly spot which ones are <b>consuming budget without delivering proportional engagement</b>.</p>

          <p id="interpreting-plt">Another metric we analyzed was the ratio of <b>Amount Spent vs. Unique Link Clicks (ULC)</b>, which reflects the <b>true cost-efficiency</b> of each campaign. <br><br><b>SHU_6 (Educators and Principals)</b> stands out as a <b>high-budget campaign with comparatively low ULC</b>, which means <b>poor ROI</b> and inefficient audience engagement. <br><br>On the other hand, campaigns that maintain <b>moderate spending and higher ULC</b>, like SHU_3 (Students outside India & US), show <b>better performance and greater cost-effectiveness.</b></p>

            <h4>Top Performers:</h4>

            <p id="interpreting-plt"><b>SHU_Students (Nigeria)</b> and <b>SHU3_ (Students Apart from India and US)</b> have high CTR and low CPC (~$1). <br><br> These are both <b>cost-effective and highly engaging campaigns</b>, which makes them ideal for continued investment.</p>
            <h4>Poor Performers:</h4>

            <p id="interpreting-plt"><b>SHU_Students (Australia)</b> and <b>SHU_Students (UK)</b> show low-to-moderate CTR paired with very high CPC, which means that these campaigns are expensive with weak returns. <br><br> <b>SHU_Students (Nepal)</b> also falls into this underperforming group, as it combines low CTR with a moderate to high spend.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p id="interpreting-plt">After a detailed performance evaluation of all 11 Facebook ad campaigns, we recommend <b>discontinuing the SHU_Students (Australia) campaign</b> because of its <b>inefficiency and high cost</b>. <br><br> Additionally, we recommend optimizing the <b>United Kingdom campaign</b> because we see that there's potential for growth in that campaign.</p>
        <h3 id="reason-to-drop">Why Drop Australia?</h3>
        <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
        <h4 id="supporting-evidence">Supporting Evidence:</h4>
        <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
  <p id="interpreting-plt">The SHU_Students (Australia) campaign has the <b>highest Cost Per Click (CPC)</b> at <b>$7.15</b>, which is <b>213% higher</b> than the average CPC of <b>$2.28</b> and over <b>21 times more</b> than the CPC for the best-performing Nigeria campaign (<b>$0.34</b>). <br><br> Engagement is also low, with a <b>CTR of just 3.3%</b>, well below the <b>4.2% campaign average</b>. <br><br> Despite reaching <b>14,492</b> people, the conversion metrics remain unimpressive. The campaign is a budget drain, with a total spend of <b>$850</b>, accounting for <b>7% of the total marketing budget</b>. Removing this campaign would save <b>$850</b> immediately, <b>boost overall efficiency by approximately 18%</b>, and allow reallocation of resources to <b>high-performing campaigns</b> with better ROI.
</p>
    <h3 id="campaign-for-opt">Campaign We Suggest For Optimization</h3>
    <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
    <h4>SHU_Students (UK):</h4>
    <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
<p id="interpreting-plt">
  The campaign has a <b>CPC of $7.08</b> and a <b>CTR of 3.0%</b>. While this performance is slightly better than the Australia campaign, it is still not <b>cost-effective</b>. We recommend that this campaign undergo optimization and/or A/B testing before any further investment is made. But there is some potential for improvement.

    <h3 id="retain-and-expand">Top-Performing Campaigns (To Retain and Expand)</h3>
  <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
  <h4>SHU_Students (Nigeria):</h4>
  <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
  <p id="interpreting-plt">This campaign achieved a <b>CTR of 9.5%</b> and a <b>CPC of $0.34</b>, which makes it the most efficient and engaging campaign overall.</p>
  <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
  <h4>SHU3_ (Students Apart from India and US):</h4>
  <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
  <p id="interpreting-plt">With a <b>CTR of 5.6%</b> and a <b>CPC of $0.42</b>, this campaign has a strong balance of high engagement and low cost.</p>
  <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
  <h4>SHU_Students (USA):</h4>
  <div style="height: 16px;"></div>
  <p id="interpreting-plt">Although the <b>CPC is higher at $5.04</b>, the campaign maintains a solid <b>CTR of 6.1%</b> and delivers good engagement levels.
</p>
<h3 id="final-note">Final Note</h3>
<p id="interpreting-plt">By dropping underperforming campaigns like <b>Australia</b>, and focusing resources on high-impact campaigns and regions such as <b>Nigeria</b> and <b>SHU_3</b>, the marketing team can achieve better results with lower cost, enhancing both reach and ROI. In the second week, we will justify this decision by further investigation.</p>
